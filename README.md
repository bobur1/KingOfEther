# King Of Ether

My Implementation of King Of Ether. See original in  [solidity-by-example.org](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/denial-of-service/) 

**Main idea:**
Potentially, the new king can become the acting king after transferring more ether to the contract than the previous king. When the king changes, the dethroned king gets his original investment back.
